# How to use PostgreSQL extensions for Azure Database for PostgreSQL

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/postgresql/includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]

Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server allows you to extend the functionality of your database using extensions. Extensions bundle multiple related SQL objects in a single package that can be loaded or removed from your database with a command. After being loaded into the database, extensions function like built-in features.

## Allow extensions

Before installing extensions in Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server, you must allow these extensions to be listed for use.

#### [Portal](#tab/portal)

Using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com):

1. Select your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance.
1. From the resource menu, under **Settings** section, select **Server parameters**.
1. Search for the `azure.extensions` parameter.
1. Select the extensions you wish to allow.

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

You can allow extensions via the CLI parameter set [command](/cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server/parameter?view=azure-cli-latest&preserve-view=true).

```azurecli
    az postgres flexible-server parameter set --resource-group <resource_group> Â --server-name <server> --subscription <subscription_id> --name azure.extensions --value <extension_name>,<extension_name>
```

#### [Resource Manager Template](#tab/azure-resource-manager)

Using the [ARM Template](/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/):

The following example adds extensions to the allowlist `dblink`, `dict_xsyn`, `pg_buffercache` on a server whose name is `postgres-test-server`:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2019-04-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
    "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
    "parameters": {
        "flexibleServers_name": {
            "defaultValue": "postgres-test-server",
            "type": "String"
        },
        "azure_extensions_set_value": {
            "defaultValue": " dblink,dict_xsyn,pg_buffercache",
            "type": "String"
        }
    },
    "variables": {},
    "resources": [
        {
            "type": "Microsoft.DBforPostgreSQL/flexibleServers/configurations",
            "apiVersion": "2021-06-01",
            "name": "[concat(parameters('flexibleServers_name'), '/azure.extensions')]",
            "properties": {
                "value": "[parameters('azure_extensions_set_value')]",
                "source": "user-override"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Load libraries

`shared_preload_libraries` is a server configuration parameter that determines which libraries have to be loaded when Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server starts. Any libraries that use shared memory must be loaded via this parameter. If your extension needs to be added to the shared preload libraries, follow these steps:

Using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com):

1. Select your Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance.
2. From the resource menu, under **Settings** section, select **Server parameters**.
3. Include the libraries you wish to add in the value of `shared_preload_libraries`.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-allow-extensions/shared-libraries.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Server parameters page while setting shared_preload_libraries." lightbox="media/how-to-allow-extensions/shared-libraries.png":::

You can set `shared_preload_libraries` via the CLI [parameter set](cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server/parameter?view=azure-cli-latest#az-postgres-flexible-server-parameter-set) command.

```azurecli
az postgres flexible-server parameter set --resource-group <resource_group> --server-name <server> --name shared_preload_libraries --value <extension_name>,<extension_name>
```

4. Because `shared_preload_libraries`is a static server parameter, it requires a server restart so that the changes take effect.

    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-allow-extensions/save-and-restart.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Server parameters page, showing the dialog from which you can save changes and restart." lightbox="media/how-to-allow-extensions/save-and-restart.png":::

You can restart the server via the CLI [parameter set](cli/azure/postgres/flexible-server?view=azure-cli-latest#az-postgres-flexible-server-restart) command.

```azurecli
az postgres flexible-server restart --resource-group <resource_group> --name <server>
```

## Create extensions

After an extension is allowlisted and, if the extension requires it, is also added to `shared_load_libraries`, it can be created or installed in each database on which it's to be used.

1. To create an extension, a user must be a member of the `azure_pg_admin` role.

1. Run the [CREATE EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createextension.html) command to create or install a particular extension. This command loads the packaged objects into your database.

> [!NOTE]  
> Third-party extensions offered in Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server are open-source licensed code. We don't offer any third-party extensions or extension versions with premium or proprietary licensing models.

Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance supports a subset of key PostgreSQL extensions, as listed in [supported extensions by name](concepts-extensions-versions.md) or in [supported extensions by version of PostgreSQL](concepts-extensions-by-engine.md). This information is also available by running `SHOW azure.extensions;`. Extensions not included in those lists aren't supported on Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server. You can't create or load your own extensions in Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server.

## Drop extensions

To drop an extension it's also required that it's [allowlisted](#allow-extensions).

1. To drop an extension, a user must be a member of the `azure_pg_admin` role.

1. Run the [DROP EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-dropextension.html) command to drop or uninstall a particular extension. This command drops the objects packaged in the extension from your database.

## Update extensions

To update an installed extension to the latest available version supported by Azure, use the following SQL command:

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION <extension_name> UPDATE;
```

This command simplifies the management of database extensions by allowing users to manually upgrade to the latest version approved by Azure, enhancing both compatibility and security.

### Limitations

While updating extensions is straightforward, there are certain limitations:

- **Selection of a specific version**: The command doesn't support updating to intermediate versions of an extension.
    - It constantly updates the [latest available version](concepts-extensions-versions.md).

- **Downgrading**: Doesn't support downgrading an extension to a previous version. If a downgrade is necessary, it might require support assistance and depends on the availability of the previous version.

## View installed extensions

To list the extensions currently installed on your database, use the following SQL command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_extension;
```

## Possible errors

### extension "%s" is not allow-listed for "azure_pg_admin" users in Azure Database for PostgreSQL

This error occurs when you run a `CREATE EXTENSION` or `DROP EXTENSION` command referring to an extension that is not [allowlisted](#allow-extensions), or an extension that isn't supported yet on the instance of Azure Database for flexible server on which you're running the command.

### Only members of "azure_pg_admin" are allowed to use CREATE EXTENSION

This error occurs when the user that runs a `CREATE EXTENSION` command is not a member of `azure_pg_admin` role.

### Only members of "azure_pg_admin" are allowed to use DROP EXTENSION 

This error occurs when the user that runs a `DROP EXTENSION` command is not a member of `azure_pg_admin` role.
