Azure Cosmos DB for Table exposes a unique set of data actions within its native role-based access control implementation. This article includes a list of those actions and descriptions on what permissions are granted for each action.

## Data actions

Here's a list of data actions that can be individually set in a role definition.

| **`Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/readMetadata`** | Read some account metadata |
| **`Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/tables/containers/executeQuery`** | Executes a query against a table |
| **`Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/tables/containers/executeStoredProcedure`** | Executes a table transaction (procedure) |
| **`Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/tables/containers/entities/create`** | Creates a new entity (item) |
| **`Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/tables/containers/entities/read`** | Point reads an individual entity (item) using the row and partition keys |
| **`Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/tables/containers/entities/replace`** | Entirely replaces an existing entity (item) |
| **`Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/tables/containers/entities/upsert`** | Creates an entity (item) if it doesn't exist or replaces the entity if it already exists |

### Data action wildcards

The wildcard (`*`) operator is supported at the `tables`, `containers`, and `entities` levels for actions. Use the wildcard to grant broad access to a specific resource type.

| | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/tables/*`** | Perform all operations on tables |
| **`Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/tables/containers/*`** | Perform all operations on containers |
| **`Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/tables/containers/entities/*`** | Perform all operations on entities (items) |
| **`Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/throughputSettings/*`** | Perform all operations related to throughput |
