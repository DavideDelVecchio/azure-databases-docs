# Integrations

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL](../includes/appliesto-nosql.md)]


Azure Cosmos DB seamlessly integrates with leading large language model (LLM) orchestration packages like [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) and [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), enabling developers to harness the power of advanced AI capabilities within their applications. These orchestration packages can streamline the management and use of LLMs, embedding models, and databases, making it even easier to develop Generative AI applications.

## Semantic Kernel
[Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/semantic-kernel/overview/) is an open-source framework, developed by Microsoft, that allows developers to build advanced AI applications by integrating AI agents with conventional programming languages like C#, Python, and Java, enabling seamless orchestration of code and AI models.

## LangChain
[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs), providing modular components and tools for building, deploying, and monitoring context-aware reasoning applications. LangChain is supported in Python, JavaScript, and Java (through a third party effort)

## CosmosAIGraph
[CosmosAIGraph](https://aka.ms/cosmosaigraph) uses Azure Cosmos DB to create AI-powered knowledge graphs, integrating advanced graph database capabilities with AI for robust data management and querying. It utilizes Cosmos DBâ€™s scalability and performance to build sophisticated data models, uncovering hidden relationships and concepts in semi-structured data.
