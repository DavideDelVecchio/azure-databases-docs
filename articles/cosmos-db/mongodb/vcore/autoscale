# Autoscale for vCore-based Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (public preview)

[!INCLUDE[MongoDB (vCore)](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/cosmos-db/includes/appliesto-mongodb-vcore.md)]

Managing databases with fluctuating workloads can be complex and costly, especially when unpredictable traffic spikes require overprovisioning resources. To address this 
challenge, Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB introduces Autoscale for its vCore-based clusters. Autoscale is designed to handle variable workloads by dynamically adjusting capacity 
in real-time, scaling up or down based on application demands.

Unlike other managed MongoDB solutions, which often experience delays of several hours when scaling up and more than 24 hours 
for scaling down, Azure Cosmos DB's Autoscale offers instant scalability. This feature ensures that your database adapts 
immediately to changing workloads, eliminating performance bottlenecks and avoiding unnecessary costs.

## Get started

Follow this document to [create a new Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore)](quickstart-portal.md) cluster and just select 'M200-Autoscale tier (Preview)' checkbox. 
Alternatively, you can also use [Bicep template](quickstart-bicep.md) to provision the resource.

## Benefits

1. Instant Scale

* Automatically adjusts capacity without downtime, maintaining performance during unexpected workload spikes.
* Eliminates the need for manual scaling, reducing the risk of service disruptions.

2. Cost Efficiency

* Reduces expenses by preventing overprovisioning, utilizing resources only when necessary.
* Pay-as-you-use pricing ensures that youâ€™re only billed for actual usage, maximizing resource utilization.

3. Predictable Pricing

* Core-based pricing with transparent cost calculations makes budgeting and forecasting easier.
* Flexible pricing model adapts to workload demands, avoiding unexpected cost spikes.

## Pricing Model

For simplicity it uses a core-based pricing model, where charges are based on the higher of CPU or committed memory usage 
in the last hour, compared to a 35% utilization threshold.

* Below 35% Utilization: Minimum price applies.
* Above 35% Utilization: Maximum price applies.
* Autoscale clusters incur a 50% premium over the base tier due to their instant scaling capabilities.
* Billing Frequency: Costs are calculated and billed hourly, ensuring you only pay for the capacity you use.

### Example:
In a scenario where an application experiences usage spikes for 10% of its runtime:

* Without Autoscale: An overprovisioned M200 cluster would cost $1,185.24.
* With Autoscale: An M200-Autoscale cluster would cost $968.41, offering a savings of 18.29%.

This flexible pricing model helps reduce costs while maintaining optimal performance during peak demand.

## Restrictions

1. Currently, only the M200 Autoscale tier is supported, allowing scaling within the range of M80 to M200 tiers.
2. Autoscale applies only to compute resources. Storage capacity must still be scaled manually.
3. Upgrades or downgrades between the General Tier and Autoscale Tier are not supported at this time.


## Next steps

Having explored the capabilities of the Autoscale tier in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore), the next step is to dive into the migration journey. This involves understanding how to conduct a migration assessment and planning a seamless transfer of your existing MongoDB workloads to Azure.
