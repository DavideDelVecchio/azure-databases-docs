# Develop a console app to connect to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore

In this guide, you build a console application to connect to an Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster. This guide will cover the required steps to connect using Microsoft Entra authentication from your signed-in identity.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

This guide will use the open-source `MongoDB.Driver` library from NuGet.

:::zone-end
::: zone pivot="programming-language-ts"
:::zone-end
::: zone pivot="programming-language-python"
:::zone-end

After authenticating, you can use this library to interact with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore using the same methods and classes you would typically use to interact with any other MongoDB or DocumentDB instance.

## Prerequisites

- An existing Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore) cluster.

::: zone pivot="programming-language-csharp"

- .NET 9.0 or later
