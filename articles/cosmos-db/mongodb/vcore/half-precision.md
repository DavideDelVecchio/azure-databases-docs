# Half-Precision Vector Indexing in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore)

## What is Half-Precision Vector Indexing?

Half-precision vector indexing allows you to store and index vector embeddings using 16-bit floating-point numbers instead of the standard 32-bit floats. This optimization leads to substantial reductions in both memory usage and storage costs, making it more feasible to work with larger datasets and higher-dimensional vectors. Furthermore, by optimizing data density, it can contribute to improved query performance in many vector search scenarios.

## Key Benefits

* **Increased Dimensionality Support:** With half-precision, you can now index vectors with up to **4,000 dimensions**. 
* **Reduced Storage Footprint:** Storing vectors in a 16-bit format significantly decreases the amount of storage required compared to full-precision vectors. This can lead to considerable cost savings, especially for large-scale vector databases.
* **Configurable Performance vs. Precision:** To fine-tune your search results, we provide an **oversampling** parameter during query execution. This allows you to control the trade-off between retrieval speed and the potential impact of reduced precision.

## Creating a Half-Precision Vector Index

When defining a vector index for your collection, you can enable half-precision compression by specifying the `"compression": "half"` option within the `cosmosSearchOptions`.

### Index Specification Parameter

* `"compression": "half"`: Activates half-precision compression for the vector data in the index.

```javascript
db.runCommand({
  "createIndexes": "your_vector_collection_name",
  "indexes": [
    {
      "key": { "your_vector_field_name": "cosmosSearch" },
      "name": "your_index_name",
      "cosmosSearchOptions": {
        "kind": "vector-hnsw",
        "similarity": "L2",
        "dimensions": your_vector_dimension_count,
        "compression": "half"
      }
    }
  ]
});
```

### Searching a Half-Precision Vector Index

When querying a vector index that utilizes half-precision compression, you can use the `"oversampling"` parameter within the `$search` aggregation stage. This parameter helps to mitigate any potential loss of precision introduced by the 16-bit representation.

## Search Specification Parameter

`"oversampling": double`: A scaling factor that determines the number of candidate vectors to retrieve from the index before ranking them using the original, full-precision vectors.
- Minimum value: `1.0`
- Only applicable when `"compression": "half"` is used for the index.

```javascript
db.your_vector_collection_name.aggregate([
  {
    "$search": {
      "cosmosSearch": {
        "vector": your_query_vector,
        "path": "your_vector_field_name",
        "k": number_of_results_to_return,
        "efSearch": your_efSearch_value,
        "oversampling": your_oversampling_factor // e.g., 1.5, 2.0
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "$project": {
      "similarityScore": { "$meta": "searchScore" },
      "_id": 0
    }
  }
]);
```

### Understanding Oversampling

The `oversampling` factor allows you to retrieve more potential nearest neighbors from the half-precision index than the final number of results you want (`k`). These candidates are then compared using the original full-precision vectors to ensure higher accuracy in the final ranked results. For instance, if you set `k` to 10 and `oversampling` to 1.5, the system will fetch 15 candidate vectors from the half-precision index and then rank the top 10 based on their full-precision values.
