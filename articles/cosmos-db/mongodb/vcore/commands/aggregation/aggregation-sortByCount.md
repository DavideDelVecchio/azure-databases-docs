# $sortByCount (Aggregation Pipeline Stage)
The $sortByCount stage in the aggregation pipeline is used to group documents by a specified expression and then sort the count of documents in each group in descending order. This stage is particularly useful for quickly identifying the most common values within a dataset.

## Syntax
The syntax for the $sortByCount stage is:

```json
{
  $sortByCount: <expression>
}
```

expression: This is the field or computed expression on which to group and count the documents.

## Example(s)
Consider a collection named stores with documents structured as described earlier. To find out the most common promotional events based on their names, you can use the $sortByCount stage as follows:

### Example 1: Count and Sort Promotional Events by Event Name
```json
db.stores.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$store.promotionEvents" },
  { $sortByCount: "$store.promotionEvents.eventName" }
])
```

This pipeline will: 1. Use $unwind to deconstruct the promotionEvents array field from the input documents. 2. Use $sortByCount to group by the eventName field and count the number of occurrences of each event name, sorting the results in descending order of the count.

### Example 2: Count and Sort Sales by Category Name
```json
db.stores.aggregate([
  { $unwind: "$store.sales.salesByCategory" },
  { $sortByCount: "$store.sales.salesByCategory.categoryName" }
])
```

This pipeline will: 1. Use $unwind to deconstruct the salesByCategory array field from the input documents. 2. Use $sortByCount to group by the categoryName field and count the number of occurrences of each category name, sorting the results in descending order of the count.
