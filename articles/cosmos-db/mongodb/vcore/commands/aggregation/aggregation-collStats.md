# $collStats (as Aggregation Pipeline Stage)
This section will have an introduction to the command, its use cases, and behavior.

The $collStats stage in the aggregation pipeline is used to return statistics about a collection. This stage can be particularly useful for understanding the performance characteristics of a collection, such as the number of documents, the size of the collection, and storage statistics. It provides detailed information that can help with database optimization and monitoring.

## Syntax
This section will have the syntax of the command and its parameter definitions.

```json
{
  $collStats: {
    latencyStats: { histograms: <boolean> },
    storageStats: { scale: <number> },
    count: {}
  }
}
```

## Parameters

| | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`latencyStats`** | Optional. Specifies whether to include latency statistics. The `histograms` field is a boolean that indicates whether to include histograms of latency data. |
| **`storageStats`** | Optional. Specifies whether to include storage statistics. The `scale` field is a number that indicates the scale factor for the storage statistics. |
| **`count`** | Optional. Includes the count of documents in the collection. |

## Example(s)
This section will have one or more examples that will help explain the command usage.

### Example 1: Basic Collection Statistics
```json
db.store.aggregate([
  {
    $collStats: {
      count: {}
    }
  }
])
```

This example returns the count of documents in the store collection.

### Example 2: Collection Statistics with Latency and Storage Stats
```json
db.store.aggregate([
  {
    $collStats: {
      latencyStats: { histograms: true },
      storageStats: { scale: 1 }
    }
  }
])
```

This example returns latency statistics with histograms and storage statistics scaled to bytes for the store collection.
