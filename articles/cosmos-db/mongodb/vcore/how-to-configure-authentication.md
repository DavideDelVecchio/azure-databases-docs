# Use Microsoft Entra ID users for authentication with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore

In this article, you configure administrative Microsoft Entra ID users to be used with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore. You also learn how to use a Microsoft Entra ID token with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore. Microsoft Entra ID user can be a user or a service principal.

Microsoft Entra ID users added to the cluster are going to be in addition to native DocumentDB users defined on the cluster. An Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster is created with one built-in native DocumentDB user. You can add more native DocumentDB users after cluster provisioning is completed.

## Prerequisites

Users need to be allowed to sign in to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore in the Microsoft Entra ID tenant. These steps should be performed **once** for the Microsoft Entra ID *tenant* that is going to be used for authentication on Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore clusters.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Entra ID tenant administrator permissions are needed to make the change. See [guidance for troubleshooting permissions](/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/add-application-portal-configure#prerequisites).

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

1. Search for 'Microsoft Entra ID' in [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Open 'Microsoft Entra ID' service.
1. On the **Overview** page of Microsoft Entra ID service in the **Overview** section, search for 'b4fa09d8-5da5-4352-83d9-05c2a44cf431' application ID.
1. Choose 'Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore AAD Authentication' enterprise application in the search results.
1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore AAD Authentication** enterprise application, choose **Properties** page.
1. Set **Enabled for users to sign-in?** to **Yes** and save the change.

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

```azurecli
az ad sp update --id b4fa09d8-5da5-4352-83d9-05c2a44cf431 --set accountEnabled=true
```
---

> [!NOTE]
> Editing enterprise application's properties such as "Enabled for users to sign-in" requires permissions granted to a user with privileges to update enterprise application properties. users, such as **Enterprise application owner**, must have the *"update enterprise application properties"* permisssion. For more information, see [Microsoft Entra least privileged users by task - Enterprise applications](/entra/identity/user-based-access-control/delegate-by-task#enterprise-applications).

## Enable Microsoft Entra ID authentication method on Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster

When an Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster is created, only native DocumentDB authentication is enabled on it. To allow Microsoft Entra ID users access cluster's database, Microsoft Entra ID authentication method should be enabled. Follow these steps to enable Microsoft Entra ID authentication method in [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli):

1. Enable Microsoft Entra ID authentication on cluster in addition to the native DocumentDB authentication:
```azurecli
az rest --method PUT --url https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/mongoClusters/<clusterName>?api-version=2025-04-01-preview --body "{'location': '<cluterRegion>', 'properties': {'authConfig': {'allowedModes': ['MicrosoftEntraID', 'NativeAuth'] } } }"
```
1. Verify that Microsoft Entra ID authentication method is enabled on the cluster:
```azurecli
az rest --method GET --url https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourceGroups/<resourceGroup>/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/mongoClusters/<clusterName>?api-version=2025-04-01-preview
```

If you see the following in the output, Microsoft Entra ID authentication method is enabled on the cluster.

```azurecli
    "authConfig": {
      "allowedModes": [
        "MicrosoftEntraID",
        "NativeAuth" ] }
```

## Add Microsoft Entra ID administrative users to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster

To add or remove Microsoft Entra ID users with administative permissions on cluster, follow these steps:

1. Get OIDC identifier for the security principal such as Entra ID user that needs to be added to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster.
    1. Search for 'Microsoft Entra ID' in [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    1. Open 'Microsoft Entra ID' service.
    1. On the **Overview** page of Microsoft Entra ID service in the **Overview** section, search for the user to be added, e.g. dbadmin@contoso.com.
    1. Choose the user account in the search results.
    1. On the **Overview** tab of the **Overview** page of the user account, copy **Object ID** identifier.
        1. Object ID has 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-1234567890ab format.
        1. This is the OIDC identifier used to login to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore cluster.
1. Add Entra ID user as an administrator to the cluster:
```azurecli
az rest --method PUT \
--url https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/mongoClusters/{cluster-name}/users/{oidc-identifier}?api-version=2025-04-01-preview \ 
-- body { "location": "**cluster-region**", "properties": { "identityProvider": { "type": "MicrosoftEntraID", "properties": { "principalType": "User" } }, "roles": [{"db": "admin", "role": "dbOwner"}] } }
```
1. Verify that Entra ID account is added to the cluster: 
```azurecli
az rest --method GET \
--url https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/mongoClusters/{cluster-name}/users?api-version=2025-04-01-preview
```
1. Remove Entra ID user from the cluster: 
```azurecli
az rest --method DELETE \
--url https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/mongoClusters/{cluster-name}/users/{oidc-identifier}?api-version=2025-04-01-preview 
```


## Connect to Azure Cosmos for MongoDB by using Microsoft Entra ID authentication

Microsoft Entra ID integration works with standard MongoDB client tools like **psql**, which aren't Microsoft Entra ID aware and support only specifying the username and password when you're connecting to MongoDB. In such cases, the Microsoft Entra ID token is passed as the password.

We tested the following clients:

- **psql command line**: Use the `PGPASSWORD` variable to pass the token.
- **Other libpq-based clients**: Examples include common application frameworks and object-relational mappers (ORMs).
- **pgAdmin**: Clear **Connect now** at server creation.

Use the following procedures to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID as an Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore user. You can follow along in [Azure Cloud Shell](/azure/cloud-shell/get-started), on an Azure virtual machine, or on your local machine.

### Sign in to the user's Azure subscription

Start by authenticating with Microsoft Entra ID by using the Azure CLI. This step isn't required in Azure Cloud Shell.

```azurecli
az login
```

The command opens a browser window to the Microsoft Entra ID authentication page. It requires you to give your Microsoft Entra ID user name and password.

The user account name you use to authenticate (for example, user@tenant.onmicrosoft.com) is the one the access token will be generated for in the next step.

<a name='retrieve-the-azure-ad-access-token'></a>

### Retrieve the Microsoft Entra ID access token

Use the Azure CLI to acquire an access token for the Microsoft Entra ID authenticated user to access Azure Cosmos for MongoDB. Here's an example:

```azurecli-interactive
az account get-access-token --resource https://token.MongoDB.cosmos.azure.com
```

After authentication is successful, Microsoft Entra ID returns an access token for current Azure subscription:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "[TOKEN]",
  "expiresOn": "[expiration_date_and_time]",
  "subscription": "[subscription_id]",
  "tenant": "[tenant_id]",
  "tokenType": "Bearer"
}
```

The TOKEN is a Base64 string. It encodes all the information about the authenticated user and is associated with the Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore service. The token is valid for at least 5 minutes with the maximum of 90 minutes. The **expiresOn** defines actual token expiration time.

### Use a token as a password for signing in with client psql

When connecting, it's best to use the access token as the MongoDB user password.

While using the psql command-line client, the access token needs to be passed through the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable. The reason is that the access token exceeds the password length that psql can accept directly.

Here's a Windows example:

```cmd
set PGPASSWORD=<TOKEN value from the previous step>
```

```powerShell
$env:PGPASSWORD='<TOKEN value from the previous step>'
```

Here's a Linux/macOS example:

```bash
export PGPASSWORD=<TOKEN value from the previous step>
```

You can also combine the previous two steps together using command substitution. The token retrieval can be encapsulated into a variable and passed directly as a value for `PGPASSWORD` environment variable:

```bash
export PGPASSWORD=$(az account get-access-token --resource https://token.MongoDB.cosmos.azure.com --query "[accessToken]" -o tsv)
```


> [!NOTE]
> Make sure PGPASSWORD variable is set to the Microsoft Entra ID access token for your
> subscription for Microsoft Entra ID authentication. If you need to do MongoDB user authentication
> from the same session you can set PGPASSWORD to the MongoDB user password
> or clear the PGPASSWORD variable value to enter the password interactively.
> Authentication would fail with the wrong value in PGPASSWORD.

Now you can initiate a connection with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore using the Microsoft Entra ID user account that the access token was generated for. You would do it as you usually would with the user account as the user and without 'password' parameter in the command line:

```sql
psql "host=mycluster.[uniqueID].MongoDB.cosmos.azure.com user=user@tenant.onmicrosoft.com dbname=[db_name] sslmode=require"
```

### Use a token as a password for signing in with PgAdmin

To connect by using a Microsoft Entra ID token with PgAdmin, follow these steps:

1. Clear the **Connect now** option at server creation.
1. Enter your server details on the **Connection** tab and save.
    1. Make sure a valid Microsoft Entra ID user is specified in **Username**.
1. From the pgAdmin **Object** menu, select **Connect Server**.
1. Enter the Microsoft Entra ID token password when you're prompted.

Here are some essential considerations when you're connecting:

- `user@tenant.onmicrosoft.com` is the name of the Microsoft Entra ID user.
- Be sure to use the exact way the Azure user is spelled. Microsoft Entra ID user and group names are case-sensitive.
- If the name contains spaces, use a backslash (`\`) before each space to escape it.
- The access token's validity is 5 minutes to 90 minutes. You should get the access token before initiating the sign-in to Azure Cosmos for MongoDB.

You're now authenticated to your Azure Cosmos for MongoDB server through Microsoft Entra ID authentication.

## Manage native MongoDB users

When native MongoDB authentication is enabled on cluster, you can add and delete MongoDB users in addition to built-in 'citus' user. You can also reset password and modify MongoDB privileges for native users.

### How to delete a native MongoDB user user or change their password

To update a user, visit the **Authentication** page for your cluster,
and select the ellipses **...** next to the user. The ellipses open a menu
to delete the user or reset their password.

The `citus` user is privileged and can't be deleted. However, `citus` user would be *disabled*, if 'Microsoft Entra ID authentication only' authentication method is selected for the cluster.

## How to modify privileges for user users

New user users are commonly used to provide database access with restricted
privileges. To modify user privileges, use standard MongoDB commands, using
a tool such as PgAdmin or psql. For more information, see [Connect to a cluster](quickstart-connect-psql.md).

For example, to allow MongoDB `db_user` to read `mytable`, grant the permission:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON mytable TO db_user;
```

To grant the same permissions to Microsoft Entra ID user `user@tenant.onmicrosoft.com` use the following command:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON mytable TO "user@tenant.onmicrosoft.com";
```

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore propagates single-table GRANT statements through the entire
cluster, applying them on all worker nodes. It also propagates GRANTs that are
system-wide (for example, for all tables in a schema):

```sql
-- applies to the coordinator node and propagates to worker nodes for MongoDB user db_user
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO db_user;
```

Or for Microsoft Entra ID user

```sql
-- applies to the coordinator node and propagates to worker nodes for Azure AD user user@tenant.onmicrosoft.com
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO "user@tenant.onmicrosoft.com";
```
