# Why Mission-Critical MongoDB Workloads Should Run on Azure First-Party Services

## Summary

For regulated industries, large enterprises, and mission-critical workloads, choosing the right cloud service matters. Azure services—operated, secured, and supported by Microsoft—offer a fundamentally different level of control, compliance, and integration than third-party vendor-managed offerings. This distinction is essential when evaluating managed MongoDB services on Azure.

## First-Party vs. Third-Party: What’s the Difference?

Azure Marketplace includes both **first-party** services (built and operated by Microsoft) and **third-party** services (published by ISVs like MongoDB Inc.). These are fundamentally different in how they behave, integrate, and meet compliance expectations.

| Aspect                     | Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore             | MongoDB Atlas on Azure                         |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Operated By               | Microsoft                                     | MongoDB Inc. (third-party ISV)                 |
| Support                   | Microsoft Azure Support                       | MongoDB Inc. Support (separate contract)       |
| SLA Coverage              | End-to-end Microsoft-backed SLA                          | Vendor SLA excludes hardware, networking, and more.                           |
| Compliance Responsibility | Microsoft                                     | MongoDB Inc.                                   |
| Data Residency & Control  | Full Microsoft control plane + Azure policy   | Vendor-controlled environment                  |
| Network Integration       | Native Private Link, Entra ID (Management and Data), RBAC           | Limited/varies by vendor tier                  |

## Why This Matters for Mission-Critical Applications

### 1. **Security and Compliance**

Mission-critical workloads demand full control over data and infrastructure. First-party services like **Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore** inherit [Microsoft’s extensive compliance portfolio](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/compliance/), including:

- UAE DESC
- FedRAMP
- ISO 27001, 27017, 27018
- HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOC 1/2/3

With third-party services like Atlas, **Microsoft is not responsible for the service’s compliance posture**—the vendor is.

### 2. **Support and Escalation**

When running a native service:

- Azure Support covers everything from infrastructure to service behavior.
- No need to escalate across companies or manage vendor SLAs.
- TAMs and Microsoft support teams can engage directly, with full telemetry and control.

### 3. **Identity and Access Integration**

Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore integrates natively with:

- Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
- Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Azure policies and Private Link

This ensures centralized governance of who accesses what—and how.

### 4. **Cost, Billing, and SLA Simplicity**

- No separate billing relationships.
- No hidden premium support tiers.
- All usage appears in Azure Cost Management with unified billing and SLA.

## Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore: Enterprise-Ready, Microsoft-Operated

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore is a first-party service delivering:

- **MongoDB wire protocol compatibility**
- **Open-source engine optimizations**
- **AI-first capabilities like vector search**
- **Global scalability, autoscale, and hybrid identity**
- **Full stack SLA** covering the database, compute, storage, and networking

## Conclusion

When uptime, compliance, support, and control matter, **only a first-party Azure service provides the trust and guarantees needed**. Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore is purpose-built by Microsoft for enterprise-grade, mission-critical workloads.
