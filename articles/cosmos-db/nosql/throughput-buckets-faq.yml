title: Frequently asked questions on Throughput buckets in Azure Cosmos DB

summary: |
  [!INCLUDE[NoSQL](../includes/appliesto-nosql.md)]

  Throughput buckets in Azure Cosmos DB allow users to control the throughput available for different workloads within a container. By configuring buckets and setting a maximum throughput allocation, users can ensure workload isolation. If a bucket exceeds its assigned throughput limit, subsequent requests to that bucket will be throttled to prevent impact on other workloads.

    questions:
      - question: |
          How many throughput buckets can be configured per container?
        answer: |
          You can configure up to five (5) throughput buckets per container.
      - question: |
          Can I assign custom names to throughput buckets?
        answer: |
          No, throughput buckets cannot be named. They are automatically assigned an Id ranging from 1 to 5.
      - question: |
          What happens if a bucket exceeds its configured maximum throughput?
        answer: |
          Subsequent requests sent to that bucket will receive an HTTP 429 status code with sub-status code 3212.
      - question: |
          What happens if I delete an existing bucket?
        answer: |
          Requests sent with a deleted bucket Id (1-5) will not fail but will instead consume throughput from the overall container.
          The bucket Id will be ignored by the service.
      - question: |
          What if I assign a bucket Id lower than 1 or higher than 5 to a request?
        answer: |
          Requests with an invalid bucket Id (less than 1 or greater than 5) will result in an error, as only bucket Ids 1 to 5 are valid.
      - question: | 
          Is there any minimum throughput limit for a throughput buckets?
        answer: | 
          There is no minimum limit for throughput buckets.
          Throughput is not reserved for specific bucketsâ€”only the maximum consumption is capped based on the configuration.
      - question: | 
          How often can throughput buckets be modified?
        answer: |
          Throughput bucket configurations can be changed once every 10 minutes, otherwise the request will be throttled with an HTTP 429 status code and sub-status code 3213.
